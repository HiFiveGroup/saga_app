####Friends. Family. Building. Exploring.#####
<br>
In the Seven Habits of Highly Effective People, author Steven Covey describes all the activities of modern life landing somewhere between four quadrants:

1. Urgent and important
2. Urgent but not important
3. Important, but not urgent
4. Not urgent, not important

And on this chart, which do you think he describes as *crucial*?

Would it surprise you to hear that it's number three? Important but not urgent.

The preparation and planning of our lives, the striving towards what we honestly want and sensible prevention
of the things we don't. Building relationships, building our own bodies, and truly enjoying the world.
This is the quadrant where we truly do our living. This is where we stay present.

But even though it's the area of highest importance, for most of us it is the one with the least attention given.

Our jobs, reponsibilities, and obligations meant to enrich our lives soon take control of it.

Don't we all want a life filled with adventure, however we define it?

Enter **Saga**.

We created **Saga** as an attempt to highlight our own true desires and put an end to the constant postponement of living. Use **Saga** to list your dreams and treat them the way you treat any other goal, with details, deadlines and accountability. Meet other people with the same wild interests or lofty aspirations, create challenges across continets, and transform your life from something you watch to something you do.
